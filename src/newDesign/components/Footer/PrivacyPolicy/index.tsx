            <h2>Cookies Policy</h2>
            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
            A cookie is a piece of information in the form of a very small
            text file that is placed on an internet user's computer.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is generated by a web page server (which is basically the
            computer that operates the website) and can be used by that server
            whenever the user visits the site. A cookie can be thought of as an
            internet user's identification card, which tells a website when the
            user has returned. Cookies can't harm your computer and don't store
            any personally identifiable information about you on any of our
            cookies.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Why do we use cookies on Coinica?</h3>
            Coinica uses two types of cookies: cookies set by us, and cookies
            set by third parties (i.e., other websites or services). Coinica

            your visit and to tailor the information displayed on the site to
            your preference.
